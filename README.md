# The backend of an online marketplace

This is the backend of an online marketplace web application I built as a side project for a client. The full codebase is not available here for obvious reasons, but I saved a snapshot of the 
repository halfway through with permission,  to showcase some of the technologies used.

The Packages and technologies used are as follows.

Core packages:
  - Express.js with Node.js language
  - Mongoose for database object modelling
  - nodemon for development efficiency
  
Security and authentication:
  - bcrypt
  - Stripe
  - uid2
  - cors
  - 
Cloud based image server - Cloudinary
